# Shatter
Multi Tool + VRChat/Unity SDK 
``Requires Latest .Net Runtime.``


# Issues With Unity.

if you are having issues importing packages in general try making sure the extention ``.UnityPackage`` shows the unity icon
if it doesnt press the windows icon/key serach ``Default Apps`` look for ``.UnityPackage`` and set it to your ``unity.exe ( Editor )``


# Where's The Source Code?
at this moment Shatter will NOT be open source.
if you are worried about this software contact me directly on discord or ask in the discord server (aka where u downloaded it)
